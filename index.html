                            <p>This Overlap shed range offers a great value storage space for your garden. The shed has a high roofline and a quality build setting itself apart from the competition. This garden building is supplied with styrene glazed windows, which are 100% shatterproof and a safer alternative to glass. The rigid frame and high quality rustic overlap board makes the shed strong and sturdy. These quality sheds have strong braced double doors with the roof and floor constructed of solid sheet materials giving the shed a durable structure. The apex roof is shielded from wood rot or fungal decay by the supplied mineral roofing felt.

                                This garden building is pre-treated with a water based timber treatment for protection during transit. In order to receive the full 10 year anti-rot guarantee, it is necessary that you treat the shed with a high quality timber preservative prior to or shortly after construction. This will protect the timber from weathering and will need to be repeated accordingly in relation to manufacturer's instructions. See Terms and Conditions for further information
